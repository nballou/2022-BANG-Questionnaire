Research team: This study is run by researchers at Queen Mary University of London, the University of Pittsburgh, Imperial College London, and the University of York, led by Nick Ballou (n.b.ballou@qmul.ac.uk). 

___________________________________________________________



Thank you for considering taking part in this study. Please take a moment to read the following. Participant compensation accounts for the time required to carefully review this information.

 

Participation in this study is entirely optional. If you choose not to take part, simply close this page and there will be with no disadvantages and you will hear no more about it.

 

Study aim: We want to understand the relationship between Xbox gaming and well-being, in terms of both quantity and quality of play. 

 

Who can participate: Participants must be:

- a UK or US resident

- an active video game player who does the majority of their gaming (≥75%) on an Xbox console (Xbox 360/Xbox One/Xbox Series S/X) or via Xbox Game Pass or Xbox Remote Play

- at least 18 years old

- proficient in English

 

Why am I being invited? This study is targeted at likely Xbox users. You should not take part in this study if you do not play video games, or do not play them primarily on an Xbox console, via Xbox Game Pass, or using Xbox Remote Play.

 

What to expect: This is a 12-week long study involving 6 separate surveys. This is the first survey; you will receive the remaining 5 in 2-week intervals.  The active participation time during these 12 weeks is approximately 60–90 minutes.

 

Throughout the study, your activity on Xbox (what games you are playing and when) will be logged automatically.

 

Compensation: You will be paid for each survey you complete, in Amazon gift cards corresponding to your country of residence. 

 

- For the first survey (this one), you will be paid £3 ($3.60) for an approx. 20-minute survey

- For each of the following 5 surveys, you will be paid £1.50 ($1.80) for an approx. 10-minute survey

- If you complete all 6 waves, you will receive an additional bonus of £5 ($6). 

 

The maximum compensation is therefore £15.50 ($19.60) for 60–90 minutes of active participation.
At the end of the study, you may also elect to receive a report analyzing your play history across the duration of the study.

 

Risks: This study involves the use of your personal and identifiable data associated with your Xbox Network account and play history. To mitigate this, we store all data only on SSH-secured and GDPR-compliant storage, using University password-protected accounts. All internet traffic involving sensitive information will be routed through the University of York's secure VPN.
We will permanently remove all identifying information (Xbox ID, email) before sharing your data beyond the lead researcher, and will only share non-identifiable data from your play history and survey responses. Email addresses are used only to distribute payment and to inform participants of new surveys as they become available; these will be used for no other purposes and are not stored after the study has concluded.

 

Confidentiality: All sensitive information you provide will only be seen by the lead researcher working on this project and will not shared beyond him. This means that all data will be pseudonymized before being processed or moved from the secure University of York cloud servers where data originates. 

 

How we will use your data: Your data will be used in analyses of how gaming and wellbeing interact, and may be used in scientific publications, presentations, or other public outputs.

 

Legal basis: We will process your personal data for research purposes under Article 6 (1) (e) of the GDPR: performance of a task carried out in the public interest.

 

Your rights to your data: Under GDPR, you have a general right of access to your data, a right to rectification, erasure, restriction, objection or portability. You also have a right to withdrawal. Please note, not all rights apply where data is processed purely for research purposes.

 

Withdrawal: While the study is ongoing, you are free to withdraw at any point without any penalty or consequences. To do so, simply email the lead researcher with your Xbox ID. After the study has concluded, you have 1 month to request removal of your data, after which it will no longer be possible.

 

Contact information: If you'd like additional information, or wish to withdraw, please contact the lead researcher Nick Ballou (n.b.ballou@qmul.ac.uk). If this is unsuccessful or not appropriate, please contact the Queen Mary Ethics of Research Committee: research-ethics@qmul.ac.uk.

Friend requests are monitored manually, so it may take up to 72 hours for requests to be accepted.

 

Technical Note: A few participants have encountered a generic ""Something went wrong. Please try again later"" error when adding multiple friends in a row on the Xbox mobile app and on the Xbox Console Companion app for Windows. If you encounter this, try again on another device (e.g., the website or an Xbox console), or try again later.","Next, you will need to ensure that your activity is visible to our Xbox accounts.
