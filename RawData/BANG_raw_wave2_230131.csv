Thank you for considering taking part in this study. Please take a moment to read the following. The participant compensation in this study accounts for the time required to review this information, so no need to rush.

 

Participation in this study is entirely optional. If you choose not to take part, simply close this page and there will be with no disadvantages and you will hear no more about it.

 

Study aim: We want to develop a new questionnaire for measuring positive and negative video gaming experiences.

 

Who can participate: To participate, you need to be:

- an active video game player (≥ 1 hour of gaming during an average week)  

- 18+ years old

- proficient in English

 

What to expect: You will be asked to recall a recent gaming experience, and then will rate a series of 76 statements on a scale from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree"" with reference to that experience. 

 

Because we are trialing many potential statements, some of them may be repetitive. We ask that if you choose to participate, you give your full attention to each of them.

 

In total, the study will take approximately 10 minutes.

 

Risks: Participating in this study is not expected to have any disadvantages, risks, or discomfort.

 

Confidentiality: We do not collect any personally identifying data. 

 

How we will use your data: Your data will be used in research publications and/or conference presentations. Your data, which is non-identifying, will be stored indefinitely on the Open Science Framework, so that the data underlying the conclusions of any published work will remain available for inspection.

 

Legal basis: We will process your personal data for research purposes under Article 6 (1) (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.

 

Your rights to your data: Under the GDPR, you have a general right of access to your data, a right to rectification, erasure, restriction, objection or portability. You also have a right to withdrawal.

 

Withdrawal: You are free to withdraw within 1 month of data collection without any penalty or consequences. To do so, simply email the researcher with your Prolific ID.
