The game was overly hyped before its release, since it was being developed by people who had worked on a very good RPG game, popular for having the best story out of that game's last three installments (Fallout New Vegas).
As such, I expected good writing in ""The Outer Worlds"", or at least anything unique on it that could hold me in and entertain. Instead I got your average sci-fi ""Rich people are always the evil cruel monsters! The rebels were actually the good guys!"" story that felt too much like a clear propaganda.
